# Welcome to the Screen Brightness Control Program😊!

Hi Everyone👋! Please read this README.md before you run the `main.py` program.

This is one cool program that you can implement with less than 50 lines of code. Note that this program uses the OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Screen Brightness Control libraries. Ensure you've installed them before running the program.

## Installation Instructions

If you haven't installed the required libraries yet, follow the instructions below to set up your local environment:

### OpenCV
OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision. To install it, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### MediaPipe
MediaPipe by Google is useful for cross-platform, customizable machine learning solutions for live and streaming media. Install it by running:

```bash
pip install mediapipe
```

### Screen Brightness Control
This library allows you to control the screen brightness of your device. Install it with:

```bash
pip install screen-brightness-control
```
### Prevent Errors
After installing these libraries, you should be ready to run the `main.py` program. If you encounter any issues during installation, ensure you have the latest version of `pip`.
